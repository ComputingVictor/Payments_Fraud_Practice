## Project

This is a project for the subject Machine Learning of CUNEF Master´s in Data Science. The objective of this research is to obtain the probability of fraud in different transactions. It will be applied different types of Machine Learning models comparing the results that were found and determine the model that is the optimum.

## What did we use?

- Python 3.9.13
- Visual Studio Code
- Jupyter Notebook
